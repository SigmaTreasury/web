                    <p>
                        Credit card networks (Mastercard and Visa) set fixed global FX rates every 24 hours that are used to calculate amounts owed between issuers and acquirers.
			These rates are fixed for 24 hours irrespective of underlying market movements in respective currency pairs. Issuers and acquirers can 
			choose in which currency they wish to settle in based on a set of fixed criteria such as transaction currency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sigma Treasury provides a service allowing issuers and acquirers to setup their settlement specifically taylored to their FX therefore reducing costs by sourcing FX at more competitive rates than those offered by the card networks.
			Sigma Treasury guarantees that its rates are never less competitive
			than card networks. This provides issuers and acquirers with piece of mind that their FX risk is limited.
                    </p>
                    <p>
		      Sigma Treasury not only supports issuers in the setup of the settlement process, but completely handles the procurement (trading) of FX, management and settlement of those respective positions with FX counterparties,
			     and subsequent settlement with the card networks. The all-in-one service for issuers provides piece of mind of an end-to-end process outsourcing with limited upfront investment and foregoing the need for a dedicated 
			    Treasury FX operation to be setup by the issuer.
